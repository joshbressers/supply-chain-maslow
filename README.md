## Reproducibility
 * Reproducible content
 * Independent verification of content
## Trusting updates
 * Update components
 * Update the application
 * Update the operating system
## Artifact confidence
 * Is it signed?
 * Can we verify the signature?
 * How is the build system being secured?
 * Is the source of the project doing verification?
 * Who is watching for vulnerabilities and bugs?
 * Who is is the project?
   * Who manages it?
   * How often is it updated?
   * Are the managers easy to contact?
   * Are the managers responsive to bug reports?
## Is it free of major bugs and vulnerabilities?
 * Are there unsupported packages?
   * Are the transitive dependencies updated?
 * Do the old packages contain dangerous bugs?
 * How old are the components?
 * What is the attack surface
## What's in it?
 * SBOM
   * Including transitive dependencies
 * Are there any duplicate or unnecessary components?
